# KK_CrossEye

This is like a VR plugin but without the need of a VR headset. It works by placing 2 cameras in slightly different positions from eachother and splitting the screen 'in half' with them.

To see the 3D effect you need to cross your eyes (imagine taking your phone and putting it very close to your face) by crossing your eyes, try to move both images into one center image. You should see 3D if you do it correctly. May be difficult at first but if you're a phone gamer who plays with it very close to your face it shouldn't be that hard. 

**Please don't ruin your eyes and don't play with this without breaks, I recommend breaks every 2 minutes for at least 30 seconds.**

To add more realism, I've also coded in a **focus** mechanism which is not the best but will be improved later. If you get close enough to an object it will 'rotate the camera views' just like your eyes when you look at something very close. This allows you to get even closer to objects and still have them stay on your screen.

**The focus is very alpha:** 

*Currently it only focuses on characters.*
 
*Neck does not get focused, not sure why, probably missing a collider.*
 
*I will make it a little smoother with the next updates.*


This plugin might drop your fps **slightly** when activated. 
In my case, recording the screen completely destroyed my CPU and dropped fps to like 40. (Stays above 100fps when using the plugin without recording).

It is activated/deactivated by clicking **Numpad 1** by default. 
A config is also included for the IPD and keybind.

I suggest leaving IPD as default since it might not be fully compatible with the focus yet (will fix on next updates)

Here's a test video showing it. The effect looks much better in-game than in video.
