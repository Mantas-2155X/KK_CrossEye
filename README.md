This is like a VR plugin but without the need of a VR headset. It works by placing 2 cameras in slightly different positions from eachother and splitting the screen 'in half' with them.

To see the 3D effect you need to cross your eyes (imagine taking your finger and putting it very close to your face) by crossing your eyes, try to move both images into one center image. You should see 3D if you do it correctly.

Here's a random youtube video which explains how to do it fast and easy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNpIDSqTJ_Y

**Please don't ruin your eyes and don't play with this without breaks, I recommend breaks every 2 minutes for at least 15 seconds.**

To add more realism, I've also coded in a **focus** mechanism which is not the best but will be improved later. If you get close enough to an object it will 'rotate the camera views' just like your eyes when you look at something very close. This allows you to get even closer to objects and still have them stay on your screen.

**The focus is very alpha:**  
   *Currently it only focuses on characters.*  
   *Neck does not get focused, not sure why, probably missing a collider.*  
   *I will make it a little smoother with the next updates.*  

This plugin might drop your fps **slightly** when activated. 

It is activated/deactivated by clicking **Numpad 1** by default. 
A config is also included for various settings, including the key bind.

I suggest leaving the settings at default, however you could also adjust them to fit your eyes better. If you believe that you made a good preset you can create an 'issue' and I will add it to the list of presets.

Please be careful with the **EXPERIMENTAL** settings as they can completely mess up the focus mode. Refer to the code if you want to mess with them.

Here's a test video showing it. The effect looks much better in-game than in video. [[insert video here]]
